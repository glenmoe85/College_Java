Week 12 - Recap

Create an application that takes in 2 pieces of information from a user; a single email address and an array of 3 character domain extensions (eg com, edu, org). These should be taken in as parameters into a single method. This application only needs 2 methods; 1 that sets and computes and 1 that returns information.

The method should then do the following to validate the email address:
- Check that there is an @ symbol in the email address
- Check that there is a . before the 3 character extension
- Ensure that the domain extension is one of the 3 character Strings from the array
- 
The method should return a String that states whether or not the email address is valid, and why.
