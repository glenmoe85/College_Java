Week 9 - Characters and Strings

Create an app that takes in a String from a user and does the following:

Assume the String can only take letters spaces and full stops

·         Counts the letters

·         Counts vowels

·         Stores a new String that only contains every second letter

·         Stores the positions of each space

·         Outputs a new String with all vowels are replaced/printed as exclamation points 

Please note: Create only 1 app class, but either create multiple instantiable classes, or multiple computes to deal with each bullet point
