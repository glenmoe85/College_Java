Week 5 - Nested Conditionals

1. Develop an application that allows the user to book a hotel room. The user should be asked for their name, the required number of nights, and their age. The application should assume that each room costs 90 euro per night and then calculate and output the total cost to confirm the booking. Please note: a booking can only be confirmed if the user is at least 18.
2. Write a Java program that takes a year from user and print whether that year is a leap year or not.
  Leap Year Rules: How to Calculate Leap Years
  In the Gregorian calendar, three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:
  
    •	The year must be evenly divisible by 4;
    
    •	If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year;
    
        o	unless...
      
        o	The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
      
    •	According to these rules, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years,
    
  while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not leap years.
