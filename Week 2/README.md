For this lab you have 3 choices, listed in order of difficulty.

Please complete any 2


1. Create an application that takes in a user's monthly wage and weekly hours and calculates how much they make per year and per hour
2.  A farmer has asked you to create an application that takes in a number of eggs that has been laid. The application should calculate and output how many 6-egg boxes the farmer needs to purchase to hold the eggs, and how many eggs will be left over. NB: The code for this can be found in question 1, feel free to answer that question first if you are not confident, and then try to do this one while referring to Q1 as little as possible
